# ResNet_Internship
This repository contains the internship report I wrote after an internship as Deep Learning Researcher in Singapore

Unfortunately, due to non-discolure agreement,I can't push the code i've written.

You can find the codes on which I mainly based my work at the followings:

- [Implementation of Residual Networks in Theano for the CIFAR-10 dataset](https://github.com/Lasagne/Recipes/blob/master/papers/deep_residual_learning/Deep_Residual_Learning_CIFAR-10.py)

- [Implementation of Residual Networks in Tensorflow](https://github.com/ry/tensorflow-resnet)
